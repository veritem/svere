This is a c/cpp builder and manager


### Motivation

Its hard for me to start a new cpp project, there is no standard way to structure the project, manage it and ship it, I'm not good at cpp but have written to much of it to like it.


This project is heavely inspired by cargo which is for The rust programming language


### Licence


This project is under MIT licence
