C/CPP builder and manager


### Motivation

Its hard for me to start a new cpp project, there is no standard way to structure , develop  and ship them, I'm not good at cpp but have written to much of it to like it. And I can't wait to shre with the community a tool I'm using myself.


This project is heavely inspired by cargo which is package manager!
The rust programming language.
